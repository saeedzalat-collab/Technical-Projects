# HR Management System â€” Architecture (Led design & implementation)

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
This document summarizes the architecture I led for an internal HR platform covering:
- Employees, projects, work logs, vacation workflows
- Role-based access (Admin / Manager / Employee)
- Production on MySQL; demo/dev on H2
- Spring Boot (REST), React SPA, JWT security
